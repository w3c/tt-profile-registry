      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This document defines
      the <a href='#mediatype'><code>application/ttml+xml</code></a> media
      type and provides a registry of compact (short) identifiers that may be
      used to identify TTML processor profiles. A processor profile specifies
      a set of capabilities that a processor must support in order to process
      a document, where this profile may be defined in a specification
      document, in
      a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml1/#vocabulary-profiles">TTML
      Profile Definition Document</a>, inline within a TTML Document Instance,
      or by using a combination of these methods. This document only
      considers the first two of these methods since the third method (the use
      of inline profile definitions) is not considered to be an identifiable,
      shared profile definition, but rather, a private profile definition
      scoped to the document instance in which it is defined.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd"></section>
    <section id="purpose" class='informative'>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This document serves two purposes: (1) to define the Media Type
        <code>application/ttml+xml</code>, and (2) to define a registry
        of compact (short) identifiers of TTML processor profiles.</p>
      <p>As a registry, this document is intended to provide a central location for enumerating
        identified TTML processor profiles, or, more strictly speaking, TTML
        decoder/processors, where each entry in the registry identifies a
        particular profile which is understood to implement a processor capable
        of satisfying the constraints of a defined TTML processor profile that
        takes the form of a TTML Profile Definition Document. By utilizing a
        common registry, it is possible to avoid name collisions among different
        profile defining fora.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>In the context of this registry, the term <i>profile</i>
          means <i>processor profile</i>. It explicitly does not
          mean <i>content profile</i>. That is, nothing about the use
          of the <code>profile</code>
          or <code>codecs</code> parameters described here is
          intended to be used to identify or make claims about whether
          a TTML resource conforms with a TTML Content Profile or any
          type of TTML Profile that may be interpreted in whole or in
          part as making statements about the conformance of a TTML
          resource or the features of TTML (or other external
          specifications) actually used in the resource.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Applications using the entries in this registry are encouraged to adopt
        the following combination syntax:</p>
      <p>Employ two combination operators, '+' (AND) and '|' (OR), which may be
        used to specify, respectively, that multiple processor profiles apply
        (simultaneously) or that any processor profile of a list of profiles may
        apply individually. If both operators are used in a codecs value, then
        the '+' operator has precedence.</p>
      <p>The example: "A+B|C+D|E" states that a TTML processor that implements
        any one of A+B or C+D or E processor profiles satisfies
        the requirements to fetch and begin decode/processing of a TTML
        document, where X+Y means that both X and Y processor profiles must be
        supported, and X|Y means that either X or Y processor profile must be
        supported.</p>

              <p>The document profile of a TTMLDocument Instance may be specified using

              of which must adhere to the syntax and semantics of
              <code>ttp:profile</code> parameter defined by <a href=

                parameter with multiple-profile combinatorial
                capability. If a short (4-character) form of a profile
                is registered in
                the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-profile-registry/">TTML
                Profile Registry</a>, it is recommended that
                this <code>codecs</code> parameter be used and not
                the <code>profile</code> parameter. The nominal value
                of this parameter is a single 4 character code from
                the registry.</p>
              <p>Additionally, applications using the entries in the

                combination syntax:</p>
              <p>Employ two combination operators, '+' (AND) and '|'
                (OR), which may be used to specify, respectively, that
                multiple processor profiles apply (simultaneously) or

                apply individually. If both operators are used in a
                codecs value, then the '+' operator has precedence.</p>
              <p>The example: "A+B|C+D|E" states that a TTML processor
                that implements any one of A+B or C+D or E processor
                profiles satisfies, at first order, the requirements
                to fetch and begin decode/processing of a TTML

          <p>Same for application/xml, except constrained to either UTF-8 or UTF-16. See
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7303">IETF RFC 7303, XML Media Types, Section 3.2</a>. For the purpose of
          filling out the IANA Application for Media Type

        </dd>
        <dt class="label">Security considerations:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>As with other XML types and as noted
            in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7303">IETF RFC
            7303, XML Media Types, Section 10</a>, repeated expansion
            of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used to
            consume large amounts of memory, which may cause XML
            processors in constrained environments to fail.</p>
          <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for
            TTML and of XML in general, it is possible that
            "application/ttml+xml" may describe content that has
            security implications beyond those described
            here. However, TTML does not provide for any sort of
            active or executable content, and if the processor follows
            only the normative semantics of the published
            specification, this content will be outside TTML
            namespaces and may be ignored. Only in the case where the
            processor recognizes and processes the additional content,
            or where further processing of that content is dispatched
            to other processors, would security issues potentially
            arise. And in that case, they would fall outside the
            domain of this registration document.</p>
          <p>Although not prohibited, there are no expectations that
            XML signatures or encryption would normally be
            employed.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="label">Interoperability considerations:</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The published specification describes processing
            semantics that dictate behavior that must be followed when
            dealing with, among other things, unrecognized elements
            and attributes, both in TTML namespaces and in other
            namespaces.</p>
          <p>Because TTML is extensible, conformant
            "application/ttml+xml" processors may expect (and enforce)
            that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be
            guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD
            or Schema or that the processor will recognize all of the
            elements and attributes in the document.</p>

        <li>Each entry must include an absolute URI that serves as the
          TTML Profile Designator that identifies the processor
          profile.</li>
        <li>Each entry should include a link that references a TTML

      <h2>Registry</h2>
      <p>This section is the registry of short form profile
        identifiers. The first sub-section details how such
        identifiers should be dereferenced to profile designators, the
        specifications that define those profiles, and the contact
        organisation for each profile. The second sub-section
        describes the mechanism used by each profile to permit
        identification of the profile of a TTML Document Instance by
        inspection of that document.</p>
      <section id="registry-profile-designator-specifications">
        <h2>Profile designator and specifications</h2>
        <p>The following table defines the Profile Designator for each
          short form Profile Identifier in this Registry, alongside
          the public specification document in which the profile is
          defined, and the relevant contact organisation. Entries are
          ordered alphabetically according to the short profile
          identifier.</p>
