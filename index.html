      <p>This document defines the <a href='#mediatype'><code>application/xml+ttml</code></a> media type and provides a registry of identified TTML processor profiles. A processor profile is an identified reference to a set of capabilities that a processor supports, which may be defined in a specification document, a <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml1/#vocabulary-profiles'>TTML Profile Definition Document</a> or both.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This is a <strong>registry</strong> and may be updated without any
    notices.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="purpose">
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>TTML defines a MIME type/subtype, <code>application/ttml+xml</code>,
        that may be used to identify the content type of TTML resources. In
        addition, TTML as well as other W3C and non-W3C specifications define a
        number of processor profiles which define requirements on compliant
        processors that may decode and process a TTML document. This registry
        can be used by other entities to exchange processor profiles in a
        compact way. In certain TTML use cases, it is desirable for a processor
        to proceed with TTML resource fetch, decode, and processing only if it
        can be determined that the referenced resource is tentatively
        processable. In order to satisfy such use cases, it is possible for the
        referencing context to enumerate one or more named profiles, which, if
        supported by the processor, would allow a first-order determination to
        be made about whether a resource may be processed. We say <i>first
          order</i> here since during actual decoding of a TTML resource, the
        processor profile declarations contained within the resource may result
        in the resource being rejected.
      </p>
      <p>This registry is intended to provide a central location for enumerating
        identified TTML profiles, or, more strictly speaking, TTML
        decoder/processors, where each entry in the registry identifies a
        particular profile which is understood to implement a processor capable
        of satisfying the constraints of a defined TTML processor profile that
        takes the form of a TTML Profile Definition Document. By utilizing a
        common registry, it is possible to avoid name collisions among different
        profile defining fora.
      </p>
      <p><b>Note Well</b> that, in the context of this registry, when we use the
        term <i>profile</i>, we mean <i>processor profile</i>. We explicitly
        do not mean <i>content profile</i>. That is, nothing about the use of
        the <code>profile</code> parameter described here is intended to be
        used to identify or make claims about whether a TTML resource conforms
        with a TTML Content Profile or any type of TTML Profile that may be
        interpreted in whole or in part as making statements about the
        conformance of a TTML resource or the features of TTML (or other
        external specifications) actually used in the resource.
      </p>
      <p>Applications using the entries in this registry are encouraged to adopt
        the following combination syntax:
      </p>
      <p>Employ two combination operators, '+' (AND) and '|' (OR), which may be
        used to specify, respectively, that multiple processor profiles apply
        (simultaneously) or that any processor profile of a list of profiles may
        apply individually. If both operators are used in a codecs value, then
        the '+' operator has precedence.
      </p>
      <p>The example: "A+B|C+D|E" states that a TTML processor that implements
        any one of A+B or C+D or E processor profiles satisfies, at first order,
        the requirements to fetch and begin decode/processing of a TTML
        document, where X+Y means that both X and Y processor profiles must be
        supported, and X|Y means that either X or Y processor profile must be
        supported
      </p>

       <h2>Media Type Registration</h2>

<p>This section updates the media type, "application/ttml+xml" to add a new parameter, <code>codecs</code>. All other provisions of the
media type specification remain the same.
This supercedes the initial registration information in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-ttml1-20130924/">TTML 1.0 Second Edition</a>.</p>
<p>This section is in conformance

              <p>The document profile of a TTMLDocument Instance may be specified using
              an optional <code>profile</code> parameter, which, if specified, the value
              of which must adhere to the syntax and semantics of
              <code>ttp:profile</code> parameter defined by <a href=
              "http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-ttml1-20130924/#parameter-attribute-profile">TTML 1.0 Second Edition, Section 6.2.8 ttp:profile</a> of the published specification.</p>

            <dt class="label">codecs</dt>

            <dd>
              <p>The optional <code>codecs</code> parameter provides a short form version of the <code>profile</code> paramater with multiple-profile combinatorial capability. If a short (4-character) form of a profile is registered in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-profile-registry/">TTML Profile Registry</a>, it is recommended that this <code>codecs</code> parameter be used and not the <code>profile</code> parameter. The nominal value of this parameter is a single 4 character code from the registry.</p>
<p>Addionally, applications using the entries in the registry are encouraged to adopt the following combination syntax:
</p><p>Employ two combination operators, '+' (AND) and '|' (OR), which may be used to specify, respectively, that multiple processor profiles apply (simultaneously) or that any processor profile of a list of profiles may apply individually. If both operators are used in a codecs value, then the '+' operator has precedence.

        <dt class="label">Encoding considerations:</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Same for application/xml, except constrained to either UTF-8 or UTF-16. See
          <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt">IETF RFC 3023, XML Media Types, Section 3.2</a>. For the purpose of
          filling out the IANA Application for Media Type
          (http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/mediatypes.pl), the value <em>binary</em>
          applies.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="label">Security considerations:</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>As with other XML types and as noted in <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt">IETF RFC 3023, XML Media Types, Section 10</a>, repeated
          expansion of maliciously constructed XML entities can be used to consume large
          amounts of memory, which may cause XML processors in constrained environments
          to fail.</p>

          <p>In addition, because of the extensibility features for TTML and of XML in
          general, it is possible that "application/ttml+xml" may describe content that
          has security implications beyond those described here. However, TTML does not
          provide for any sort of active or executable content, and if the processor
          follows only the normative semantics of the published specification, this
          content will be outside TTML namespaces and may be ignored. Only in the case
          where the processor recognizes and processes the additional content, or where
          further processing of that content is dispatched to other processors, would
          security issues potentially arise. And in that case, they would fall outside
          the domain of this registration document.</p>

          <p>Although not prohibited, there are no expectations that XML signatures or
          encryption would normally be employed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="label">Interoperability considerations:</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The published specification describes processing semantics that dictate
          behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things,
          unrecognized elements and attributes, both in TTML namespaces and in other
          namespaces.</p>

          <p>Because TTML is extensible, conformant "application/ttml+xml" processors may
          expect (and enforce) that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be
          guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or that the
          processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes in the
          document.</p>
